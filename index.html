<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#d08b45; font-family:helvetica;">Portfolio!</h2>
<h4 style="font-family helvetica;">Hello! My name is Jennah Gibson, and I am a Graphic Design Student at UWF. This year, I took ART2602 which is a Introduction to Digital Studio Practice course. While coding is an entire language, it was fun to learn how to do something out of my typical range. As a class, we did all sorts of coding exercises and different tricks to learn at a heightened speed. This is my portfolio, filled with all of the major exercises from the Summer 2022 course. I hope you enjoy!</h4>

<h3 style="font-family:helvetica;">3 Pages assignment - </h3>
<h4 style="font-family:helvetica;"> The three pages assignment was all about creating a new world via story. It also allowed for free-reign in the world of coding.</h4>

<h3 style="font-family:helvetica;">Mind, Body, Soul Assignment - </h3>
<h4 style="font-family:helvetica;"> The MBS assignment allowed for us as a class to begin to see ourselves in our work. It reminded us as students that our work is a representation of who we are, not only what we do. </h4>

<h3 style="font-family:helvetica;">NMA Presentation - </h3>
<h4 style="font-family:helvetica;"> The NMA presentation got us thinking about how our work can tie into major design themes. We explored different topics and showed how they related to one another. </h4>

<h3 style="font-family:helvetica;">Josef Albers Painting Assignment - </h3>
<h4 style="font-family:helvetica;"> The painting project was something else, it showed us as designers how to work with CSS coding and coloring as a whole. It broadened our horizons to HTML and CSS alike. </h4>

<h3 style="font-family:helvetica;">Net.Art Project - </h3>
<h4 style="font-family:helvetica;"> The Net.Art project was yet another challenge, and took many days to get all of the ideas in check. It was helpful in the ways of broadening the mind and accepting new challenges. </h4>
