        <h1 style="color:yellow;"> A Man's Cheese</h1>
        <p>Upon a rocky cottage in northern Sweden, there was a man who lived alone with his dog named Daisy.
            He was a edgy old man, who often had a distaste for the children of the neighboring villages. He couldn't seem to find anyone of interest other than his precious Daisy.

        <h3 style="font family:verdana">But one Wednesday evening...</h3>
            A lady appeared on the old man's porch, bearing a large basket of local cheeses.
            She knocked and knocked, but the old man did not strain to greet her.
            The lady sighed and left her basket on the porch, stumbling back to her nearby cottage.
            Several hours later the man rose to obtain the basket, but found that it was no longer located on the porch.
            Instead, he found it foraged by a tree, with Daisy's nose right in the cheese.
            "Daisy!", he shouted, "That's a man's cheese!"
