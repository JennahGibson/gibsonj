        <p>Constance always wanted to be a painter, but no one seemed to recognize
            his talents. In his free time away from his established family, he would paint
            in the drawing room. His father said that this was a waste of time, while his mother
            stated that it may make him more popular amongst the marriage market.
            Constance wasnt interested in the marriage market, in fact, he was much more intrigued
            when it came to drawing classes and honest discussions. Constance knew that he would one
            day paint for the world.

            Many people pointed out that Constance was no good at painting, and he could never make famous works.
            Constance did not let this tear him down, but he knew that he had no desire being a pitiful painter.
            He began to attend drawing classes, and while they were not exactly what he pictured, he enjoyed
            honest and helpful feedback from the flourishing men. Constance would become a beautiful painter. </p>
