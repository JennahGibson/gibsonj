        <h3 style="color:firebrick;"...And the Handsome Criminal
            <p>A girl named Cindy was famous for her routines. She was going about her day in the
            city of New York, not minding a thing about her surroundings. She popped into her
            favorite coffee shop, where the employees knew her by name, when she realized that
            something out of the ordinary was happening outside the window.

            She realized what was happening rather quickly, but decided to just look out the window
            as a spectator. Several cop cars were speeding around the scene happening in the street, which
            appeared to Cindy as a robbery of such. The cops were scrambled, not quite being able to
            locate the criminal. However, in a flash of action, a man ran across the glass Cindy was staring
            through, eyes flickering to her location quickly. She jumped back, staring at the supposed criminal back.
            The criminal looked at Cindy, a finger rose  to his lips as he decided to calmly walk across the crime scene.
            Cindy found herself pondering over this interaction, but also wondering if she would ever see
            the criminal again.</p>
