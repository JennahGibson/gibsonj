      <p> For all three of my collages, I wanted to express how the topic made me feel as  well as how the process made me feel. I used mainly color theory to push my  ideas to the viewer. Intelligence makes me feel warm-hearted, free, but also a  little OCD. This is where I feel most confident about myself. Physical appearance  makes me a little uneasy, so I tried to display that with clashing colors and types  of imagery you wouldn’t usually see together under normal design principles.  While I’ve admitted a bit of struggle with my spirituality, as I have come of age  I’ve realized how freeing it can feel. I showed my feelings of freedom with a  calming collection of colors, blue, lavender, and green. </p>
